**Still Not Auto Starting on boot for some reason. Looking into the issue**

**SDRSync** is an automated setup for synchronizing frequencies between [wfview](https://wfview.org/) and an [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) receiver over `rtl_tcp`. I built this so I could use an Android Tablet running [SDR++](https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus) to act as a panadapter for the IC7100 I have mounted in my Truck. 

It installs all required dependencies (including RTL-SDR Blog v4 drivers and wfview), configures a systemd service, and runs three processes together:

1. **rtl_tcp** â€“ Serves your RTL-SDR dongle over the network.
2. **wfview** â€“ Provides rig control and CAT interface.
3. **sync.py** â€“ Keeps frequencies in sync between wfview and your SDR software. (This is really all you need if you just want to sync frequencies from SDR++ and WFView)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Automatic installation of RTL-SDR Blog v4 drivers.
- Automatic build and install of wfview using the official build script.
- Configurable via `/etc/sdrsync/sdrsync.env`.
- System-level service (`sdrsync.service`) that starts on boot.
- Handles proper start order and delays for stable operation.

## ðŸ›  Installation

Run the following commands on your Raspberry Pi or Debian-based system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DylanManiatakes/wfview-rtlsdr-bidirectionalsync
mv wfview-rtlsdr-bidirectionalsync SDRSync
cd SDRSync
chmod +x INSTALL.sh
./INSTALL.sh
```

The installer will:
- Detect your username automatically.
- Install build dependencies.
- Install RTL-SDR Blog v4 drivers (with DVB-T blacklist).
- Build and install wfview from source.
- Install SDRSync to `/etc/sdrsync`.
- Set up and enable the systemd service.

## âš™ Configuration

After installation, you can edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sdrsync/sdrsync.env
```

Key variables:
- `SDRSYNC_USER` â€“ User account that runs wfview and the sync script.
- `WFVIEW_BIN` â€“ Path to wfview binary.
- `RTL_TCP_BIN` â€“ Path to rtl_tcp binary.
- `PYTHON_BIN` â€“ Path to python3 binary.
- `WF_PORT` â€“ wfview rigctl port (default `4533`).
- `RTL_PORT` â€“ rtl_tcp port (default `14423`).
- `RTL_TCP_EXTRA_ARGS` â€“ Additional rtl_tcp options.

```bash
sudo systemctl start sdrsync.service
```

Stop SDRSync:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop sdrsync.service
```

Restart SDRSync:

## ðŸ”„ Updating
To update SDRSync:
```bash
cd SDRSync
git pull
chmod +x INSTALL.sh
./INSTALL.sh
```
