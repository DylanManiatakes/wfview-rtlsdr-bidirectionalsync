# SDRSync

**SDRSync** is an automated setup for synchronizing frequencies between [wfview](https://wfview.org/) and an RTL-SDR receiver over `rtl_tcp`.  
It installs all required dependencies (including RTL-SDR Blog v4 drivers and wfview), configures a systemd service, and runs three processes together:

1. **rtl_tcp** â€“ Serves your RTL-SDR dongle over the network.
2. **wfview** â€“ Provides rig control and CAT interface.
3. **sync.py** â€“ Keeps frequencies in sync between wfview and your SDR software.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Automatic installation of RTL-SDR Blog v4 drivers.
- Automatic build and install of wfview using the official build script.
- Configurable via `/etc/sdrsync/sdrsync.env`.
- System-level service (`sdrsync.service`) that starts on boot.
- Handles proper start order and delays for stable operation.

## ðŸ›  Installation

Run the following commands on your Raspberry Pi or Debian-based system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DylanManiatakes/SDRSync---IC7100-Panadapter
mv SDRSync---IC7100-Panadapter SDRSync
cd SDRSync
chmod +x INSTALL.sh
./INSTALL.sh
```

The installer will:
- Detect your username automatically.
- Install build dependencies.
- Install RTL-SDR Blog v4 drivers (with DVB-T blacklist).
